<h3>What are Performance Enhancing Drugs and How they're Used in Sport?</h3>
<div class="container">
    <p>
        Performance-enhancing drugs are substances that are used to improve any form of activity performance in humans. 
        Many PEDs used include steroids, hormones, diuretics, and other stimulants. These include anabolic steroids, HGH, EPO, stimulants and more.
        As shown in the graph below, anabolic steroids or agents are the most popular PED among athletes, with stimulants and diuretics following.
        They are used by many athletes to increase performance. Most of these PEDs increase strength, speed, stamina, and recovery. 
        They are used to manufacture results at a fast rate and to a physical level most athletes could not achieve on their own.
        Athletes use PEDs to gain that physical advantage to separate themselves from other players.
        The more they can separate themselves on the playing field with physical talent, the more money they will be paid.
        PEDs give athletes an advantage in any physical sport they play. 
        Though some are illegal, many athletes continue using PEDs for the success and money they can recieve if they are not caught.
