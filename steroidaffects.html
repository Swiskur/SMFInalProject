        <p> Taking steroids is seen by many as cheating and being dishonest.
          Players when they take PEDs have an unfair advantage against their colleagues and can take jobs away from those who worked within the rules of the league.
          The PED users knowingly take them against league rules and this is why many take offense to it as cheating.
          The chart below shows how many medals each country had stripped because of doping, and this is another instance that makes steroids unethical
          as the sporting associations are willing to strip medals and suspend players because of their usage.
          Many athletes when caught are shamed for their actions and their performances 
          are forever tainted with the idea they did so only because of steroids. This is the case even when players were 
          successful before steroids, as the idea even when not true affects all past accomplishments across their entire careers.
          Being caught using PEDs is also seen as a let down to fans and children who play the game. The kids see this and can now
          give the idea that cheating is okay to children. It creates a poor look to be a role model to kids but then get caught with whats 
          considered cheating. Kids at some ages will not be able to see the bad that has come from the player's actions 
          and could normalize the idea of cheating and taking PEDs to that child. It is expected of the athletes to be a role model to children
          and when they cheat, they are viewed to be hurting their children. When asked if steroids are a major problem, the graph below shows
          a majority of fans see it as a major problem, which means fans see steroids and the users in a bad light.

        <p>
          PEDs can create many legal problems for the athletes that are taking them and the league they play for. 
          In the U.S. the possession, distribution, or manufacturing of steroids without a legitimate medical prescription is illegal.
          This means if caught, the athlete could face legal issues including fines and possible inprisonment.
          In sports history there have been cases of steroid use that has gone as far as Congress. One example is when MLB was facing the Mitchell Report
          which is a whistlblower report that named world class baseball players such as Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, and others.
          The Report focused on MLB creating a Joint Drug Prevention policy and the investigation into the player's use  was led by Democratic United States Senator George J. Mitchell.
          This helped the league create a proper system to punish players that take steroids by suspension and losing pay.
          In 2010 Roger Clemens was charged with six felony counts, including perjury, making false statements to Congress, and obstructing a congressional investigation.
          This was because they claimed he lied to the court about taking steroids. If guilty he would've faced charges carrying a maximum combined penalty of 30 years behind bars and $1.5 million,
          showing the severe nature that athletes could potentially face legally. He was eventually found not guilty but the case ruined his image.
          Lastly another case where an athlete served jail time was when Marion Jones was caught lying to the court about taking steroids and served 6 months in jail.
          This was the only time an athlete served time for steroid use, however shows the severe implications and paths steroids can take athletes.
          Professional leagues around the world are fighting to combat steroid usage. The WADA is helping to combat steroid usage in the Olympics. These leagues and organizations
          are fighting to protect their players by enforcing their own laws and rules, creating a way where these athletes are punished through the organizations rather than through the law.

        <p>Despite the unethicality and legality troubles with steroids, there are some physical benefits influencing athletes to take the PEDs. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increases in muscle tissue due to enhanced protein synthesis</li>
          <li>Decreased body fat percentage</li>
          <li>Increased muscle strength and power</li>
          <li>Enhanced recovery from workouts and injury</li>
          <li>Better muscle endurance</li>
          <li>Increased red blood cell production</li>
        </ul>
       
      </div>
      <div id="nin" style="display: none;">
        <p>Just because they allow for short term physical attributes, steroids can cause major health affects to athletes.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Increased risk of heart disease</li>
          <li>Can cause liver damage</li>
          <li>May cause gynecomastia</li>
          <li>Problems with the heart and blood flow</li>
          <li>High blood pressure</li>
          <li>A higher risk of swollen or torn cords in the body called tendons, which attach muscle to bone</li>
          <li>Can increase aggressive behavior</li>
          <li>May cause male infertility</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    
      <div id="psychin" style="display: none;">
        <p> PEDs can not only affect an athletes physical health, but mental health. They can cause many different Psychological issues for athletes. Below are some of the mental health affects.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hallucinations and delusions</li>
          <li>Manic behavior</li>
          <li>Mood swings</li>
          <li>Psychosis</li>
          <li>Anxiety</li>
          <li>Depression</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="youthin" style="display: none">
        <p> Though uncommon, this issue has made its way into younger athletes in the high school and collegiate levels.
          The Partnership Attitude Tracking Study found that in 2013, 11% of teens reported using human growth hormone within their lifetime an increase since 2012, 
          while steroid use increased from 5% to 7% in that time frame.
          Adverse effects of steroid use in the adolescent population include acne, hepatic dysfunction, suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, unfavorable changes in the lipid profile, neurological changes (mania, aggression) and premature closure of the epiphyseal plates in the long bones.
          Many at this age do not see the long term affects of PEDs and not only this but when they do hear them they are not turned away by the harmful affects.
          A study of high school football players found that a risks-only education program failed to increase student athletes belief of any possible consequences from PED use.
          This shows that at a young age they only see the positives it can bring because the people getting caught are world class athletes who increased their skill because of the PEDs.
          This is harming the youth as they are making a rational decison for short term success that can severely harm them in the future.
