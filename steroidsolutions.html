<h3>Solution 1</h3>
<p>
The main solution would to create national and global laws to combat steroids. There should be an agency that takes all steroid cases for all major sports and events.
If they are caught they will go on trial through this agency and this agency will make the decisions for athletes punishments. I feel this way will be better off than leaving it up to leagues to settle 
as in the past some leagues have turned a blind eye to steroid ussage. Most notably this was the case for MLB in the 1990s when they didn't actively test for PED usage. I feel if it is an outside organizations
doing the testing, court case, and punishments for all sports it will help keep a firm order around the world on steroid usage in sports. 
</p>
<br>
<h3>Solution 2</h3>
<p>The next solution would be to make tougher punishments on the athletes taking the PEDs and test more often. Generally the players recieve a suspension without pay for an amount of games that is roughly half a season for most sports or sometimes a full seaosn.
    I think if they really want to combat and end PED usage in sports they have to make the punishments unbearable for players to recieve. If the punishment outweighs the reward then players will reconsider taking. The punishments should theoretically mean they 
    get a full season suspension, lose pay for that season, and pay an additional fine that will be severe. On top of this all steorid cases should go through court where the court could also fine the player or sentence to some sort of punishment like probation.
    I feel the fear of the punishments should be great or players will still continue to see the rewards outweighing the punishments and recieve mild reprecussions that many do not mind taking.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Solution 3</h3>

<p>The next solution would to fully inform the athletes from a young age against them. In school, many students do not get the proper education on this subject, and in order to stop it I feel all athletes should be required to take a course on steroids.
    This way they will truely learn the negative affects on there health and the consequences legally. 
    Again at these adolescent levels of sports, the punishment for steroids should be severe, featuring a year long ban from sports at schools. 
    Schools should also be funded by the government to perform drug testing on their athletes.
    I feel if they cracked down and educated kids on steroids the same way they did with other drugs, there would be a better result than what there is today.
</p>

<br>

<h3>Solution 4</h3>
<p>
    This solution goes for the Professional levels only, but to play devil's advocate, they could legalize steroids.
    This would give athletes the option to use PEDs if they wanted to as they know all the effects and can make an at least more educated decision on their health.
    This would also get rid of the legal responsibilities for the leagues and athletes to deal with.
    The league would probably see an increase in money as I feel most athletes would then reach new levels and elevate the performance, just like baseball did in the 1990s.
    One form of this has been created with the Enhanced Games. This is an event similar to the Olympics but all athletes can use PEDs. This will actually be a test to see how fans take of this and if it will be seen in a positive light and profit.
    Though it would never happen, nor do I promote it, but it would be interesting to see how it would play out for leagues with their players playing at new heights and to see how fans react.
